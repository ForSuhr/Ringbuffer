# Ringbuffer
This ring buffer implementation is written by referring to the ring buffer algorithm in `ringbuffer.c` and `ringbuffer.h` of an open source RTOS called ["RT-Thread"](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread). This algorithm is adapted for the transfer and caching of real-time acquired data.
